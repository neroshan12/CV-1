After ten years of living and working abroad, designing and developing luxury products for major brands, I wanted a new challenge and something which would allow me more flexibility in the future.  A highly organised and analytical Oxford graduate who is half left brain and half right brain, becoming a developer really appealed to me. I love creating things - working on projects and seeing them come to life.

Since July 2017, I have been learning to code at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/), a 16 week intensive software development bootcamp in London. My experience at Makers Academy has engrained in me the importance of best coding practices, and this is my biggest priority in looking for a Junior Developer role. I'd love to work in a supportive environment where those practices are followed.

**Tech Skills** : Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL, MongoDB

## Skills

#### Fast, independent learner

I have got myself up and running with a number of new technologies, not taught on the course at Makers Academy, from scratch in a few days. For example, one week I taught myself Node.js and Express and used it to build an Airbnb-style website, and another week I delved into Unity and Vuforia to build an Augmented Reality Presentation aid in a team.

#### Great collaborator

Years of experience productively collaborating with teams of designers, researchers & product developers to deliver complete outsourced packages of leather goods for clients (established luxury brands), from initial sketch to finished product. I have hugely enjoyed the process of building tech product in teams for group projects at Makers Academy.

#### Excellent communicator

As a consultant, in order to successfully translate project briefs between clients and product developers, I practiced frequent and precise communication, analogous to having regular stand-ups and retros.

#### Analytical thinker

As a merchandiser, in order to maximise full price sell-through, I analysed sales and stock data on a daily basis to action replenishment and repeat buys, calculate size ratios and price point architecture, and work with designers to build on bestsellers. This problem-solving ability has proved useful in deciding on coding solutions.
